Different layers of Testing
1. Unit Testing
Unit Testing is a level of software testing where individual function/method of a software are tested. 
The purpose is to validate that each function of the software performs as designed. This is normally performed by software
developers.
2. Integration Testing
Integration Testing is a level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. 
The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.Done by the testers.
3.System Testing
System Testing is a level of software testing where a complete and integrated software is tested. The purpose of this test 
is to evaluate the system's compliance with the specified requirements.
4.Acceptance Testing
Acceptance Testing is a level of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to 
evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.

Types of Acceptance Testing:
1. UAT(User Acceptance Testing)-UAT is to assess whether the Product is working for the user, correctly for the usage.
2. BAT(Bussiness Acceptance Testing)-This is to assess whether the Product meets the business goals and purposes or not. Businness 
   focus on financial benefits so example when the product undergo changes it results in extra budget so does its covered the 
   bussiness requirements.
3. CAT(Contract Acceptance Testing)-Prdt released within the contract period or not.
4. RAT(Regulation Acceptance Testing)- Whether the prdt follows the rules and regulation set up by the government.
5. OAT(Operational Acceptance Testing)- Is a non-functional testing. It mainly includes testing of recovery, compatibility, maintainability, 
   technical support availability, reliability etc
6. Alpha Testing- Internal UAT where internal member in the organization will test the product other than the developers and testers of
   that particular project such as product manangement or customer support.So they can provide improvement in look and feel of the product
   or any end result changes.
7. Beta Testing- End User testing

Techniques for Testing
BLACK BOX TESTING is defined as a testing technique in which functionality of the Application Under Test (AUT) is tested 
without looking at the internal code structure, implementation details and knowledge of internal paths of the software.
This type of testing is based entirely on software requirements and specifications. In BlackBox Testing we just focus on inputs and 
Techniques for Testingoutput of the software system without bothering about internal knowledge of the software program.Mostly done by testers
used in Integration testing
WHITE BOX TESTING is testing of a software solution's internal structure, design, and coding. In this type of testing, the code is
visible to the tester. It focuses primarily on verifying the flow of inputs and outputs through the application, improving design and 
usability, strengthening security. White box testing is also known as Clear Box testing, Open Box testing, Structural testing, Transparent
Box testing, Code-Based testing, and Glass Box testing. It is usually performed by developers.Used in Unit testing.
GRAY BOX TESTING is a software testing method which is a combination of Black Box Testing method and White Box Testing method.

Types Of Testing
1. Manual Testing : Its a type of Software Testing where Testers manually execute test cases without using any automation tools. 
                    Manual Testing is the most primitive of all testing types and helps find bugs in the software system.
2. Automation Testing : It means using an automation tool to execute your test case suite.

Automated software testing is important due to the following reasons:
1. Automated testing saves money and time.
2. Manual testing is difficult to test for multilingual sites manually while Automation doesn't face this issue if its programmed properly.
3. Automation does not require Human intervention. You can run automated test unattended (overnight)
4. Automation increases the speed of test execution.
5. Automation helps increase Test Coverage
6. Manual Testing can become boring and hence error-prone.
7. Automation testing helps in Regression Testing.It is a type of software testing  to confirm that a recent program or code change has not 
   adversely affected existing features.Regression Testing is nothing but a full or partial selection of already executed test cases 
   which are re-executed to ensure existing functionalities work fine.
8. Automated testing helps in Load Testing. It refers to the practice of modeling the expected usage of a software program by
   simulating multiple users accessing the program concurrently.It is performed to test the performance of the system or
   software application under extreme load.tools used jmeter ,load runner tool.
9. It helps in performance testing.Performance testing is the process of determining the speed, responsiveness and stability
   of a computer, network, software program or device under a workload.
   
  JUnit Testing
  JUnit is an open source Unit Testing Framework for JAVA. It is useful for Java Developers to write and run repeatable tests.
  As the name implies, it is used for Unit Testing of a small chunk of code. Developers who are following test-driven methodology
  must write and execute unit test first before any code.
